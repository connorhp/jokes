# jokes
A simple website to get and display jokes from an API

For this I used Boostrap for the orientation of the website and the Vue Framework for the implementation.
Originally I made the jokes array 1D which caused each row to be max 6 columns, which caused the text to be too skinny.
So then I changed it into a 2D array so that it would have a max columns of 3 in this case.
